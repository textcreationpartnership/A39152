            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AFter a long debate with my Self, and many weary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes ſpent in hearing the Argument under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, banded <hi>Pro &amp; Contra:</hi> I came to this Reſult, To Examine and Enquire (with all the poſſible Candor and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity I could) into the nature and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Cauſe (ſo much noiſed in the World) lately depending between the <hi>King</hi> and Seven of His Biſhops; Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating upon which, I eaſily perceived, That thro the Sophiſtical Inſinuations of ſome Deſigning men, the Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Others, and the Blind Zeal of an Unreaſonable Rabble (that neither can, not deſire to diſtinguiſh between Truth and Error, in matters Sacred or Civil) many a well-meaning man might be Impoſed upon; for which Reaſon. I conceived it a Duty to Repreſent to you and the World, an Impartial State of the Caſe, both Reſpecting matter of Fact on the one ſide, and the Right of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Inveſted in the Prince, on the other; An Abſtract of which, take with all the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49038:2"/>brevity that ſo Important a Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will Admit of: The King appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that multitudes of His Loving Subjects might be Ignorant of His Royal Inclination to the Eſtabliſhment of an Univerſal Liberty of Conſcience (in matters meerly Religious) Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding His Declaration to that purpoſe had been Publiſhed Twelve Months before, thought fit to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the ſame, with New and Further Aſſurances of His Reſolutions to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here thereunto; and ſignified His Royal Pleaſure to the Biſhops, that they ſhould Order the Reading thereof, by the Clergy of their Reſpective Dioceſſes, at the time of Divine Service; to the end, the whole Kingdom might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand His Majeſty's Care of, and Clemency to His People in general; Being a deſign ſo Heroick, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Principles ſo Primitively Chriſtian, that (perhaps) no Age can parallel in any Prince, ſince Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath flouriſhed in the World: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a Juncto of Seven Biſhops, Petion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (or rather Remonſtrated) to the King, that the Declaration was Illegal, and founded upon ſuch a Diſpenſing Power as might at Pleaſure ſet aſide all Laws: (a heavy Charge) and that it was a point of ſo great a Conſequence they could not make themſelves ſo much Parties to it, as the Reading of it in Churches amounted to: A bitter Pill to be digeſted, tho an evident and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtance of their implacable Enmity to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> how fairly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever guilded with plauſible and ſpecious Pretences.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi>'s Soveraignty thus Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, a Pamphlet to that purpoſe Printed (which ſome of the Clergy ſhewed no ſmall diſpoſition to read in the room of the Declaration) the Mobile <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>eadfully poſſeſſed with the <hi>Popery</hi> of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> It ſeemed high time for the King to Vindicate Himſelf; and therefore the Biſhops were Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to Appear before him in Council, which they did accordingly, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, owned and ſtood by the Paper preſented to the King; and being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to enter into a Recognizance to Appear and Anſwer it at Law; they refuſed, and were therefore from the Council-Board, Committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> which it ſeems they were not a little Ambitious of; for as they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed along, they Proclaimed to the People to ſtand faſt to the Proteſtant Religion, as if they had been going to Martyrdom for that Cauſe; an Ingenious way of courting the Rabble to abet their deſign of promoting the Ruine of two parts in three of all the Proteſtants in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> by blowing <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> off the Stage at one blaſt: As much as if they had ſaid, Now good People look to it, Popery is going to be impoſed on you; Oppoſe it even to the Death: An infallible way to deceive the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Crowd; for in the Language of the Ingenious <hi>Hudibras</hi>—</p>
            <q>

               <l>To what degree it is Prophane —</l>
            </q>
            <p>A Notion ſo naturally Swallowed by the hot-headed Herd, that they never conſider the Event; till the violent Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration (like a doſe of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi>) rages in their miſerable Bowels, to their unexpected Deſtruction. On the 15th day of <hi>June,</hi> being the Firſt day of the Term, they were brought to the <hi>King's Bench-Bar,</hi> by a <hi>Hab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as Corpus;</hi> where after the Councils debare on both Sides, they Entered into a Recognizance, to take their Tryals on the 29th day of the ſame Month, which accordingly they did; the matter they were Charged with,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49038:2"/>was, for making and Publiſhing a Falſe and Seditious Libel: Twelve Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being Sworn to Try the Iſſue; after a Long Tryal, they were on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 30th of <hi>June</hi> aforeſaid, brought in Not Guilty; and the Rude Multitude as well at the Tryal, as Afterwards, were not a little Uncivil, by Hiſſing, Hooping, &amp; Hollowing; but whether it proceeded from the <hi>Church-of-England-Principle</hi> of <hi>Non-Reſistance,</hi> I am not able to determine.</p>
            <p>One thing I may not Omit, That before the Tryal, it was an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Truth among the Loyal Church-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, That the Jury were pack'd, made up of Diſſenters, and Perſons diſaffected to the Biſhops; and ſuch as if it lay in their way, would hang them, if it were for nothing but their Laun Sleeves: But when they brought them in Not Guilty, they were all Good Men and True, and as clean from Sin, as the <hi>Syrian</hi> from his <hi>Leproſie,</hi> after he had been dipt ſeven times in <hi>Jordan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having given you a brief Recital of matter of Fact, I will add a few words reſpecting the Kings Soveraignty; whence it ſhall be manifeſt, That He is not only the Civil Head of the State, but the Eccleſiaſtical Head of the Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to the Conſtitution of the <hi>Church-of-England,</hi> and <hi>de jure</hi> Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan of all <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and may at pleaſure, by vertue of his Sacred Function, be concern'd <hi>Circa Sacra,</hi> about Sacred Affairs; for when the Popes Supremacy and Headſhip was Beheaded by <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> to the end he might be Divorced from <hi>Queen Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> he obtained a Statute for the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off all Apeals from <hi>Rome;</hi> and to enable the Kings Courts Spiritual and Temporal to determine the ſame, any Forreign Inhibitions, Appeals, Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Summons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be no Let or Impediment not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.12. That this King Annexed all the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, and the Pope never had greater Authority over the Church, then our Kings are Inveſted with, by Sundry Acts of Parliament; that which of Old was <hi>Papa,</hi> is no other now, then our Kings being <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But doth it not further appear, That at the Coronation of our Kings, they have the Ordination of <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> as well as the Oath of a King; otherwiſe what means thoſe ſignificant words uſed by the Biſhop, with Unction, Anthems, Prayers, and Impoſition of hands, and the ſame at the Coronation of the Prince, as at the Ordination of the Prelate, <hi>Come Holy Ghoſt, Eternal God,</hi> &amp;c? And among other things, the Biſhop ſays theſe Words, <hi>Let him obtain Favour of the People,</hi> (though the Clergy has ſhew'd him but little of late) <hi>Like</hi> Aaron <hi>in the Tabernacle,</hi> Eliſha <hi>in the Waters,</hi> Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias <hi>in the Temple; Give him</hi> Peter's <hi>Key of Diſcipline, and</hi> Paul<hi>'s Doctrine.</hi> And in Anointing, the Biſhop further ſaith, <hi>Let thoſe Hands be Anointed with Holy Oyl, as Kings and Prophets have been Anointed, and as</hi> Samuel. The Arch-Biſhop and Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> putting the Coife on the King's Head, and on His Body the Surplice; uſing this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>O Lord, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> &amp;c. Yet for all this, His Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy will be no longer allowed, than it runs on all fours, to the utter Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of all that diſſent from our Church; and he muſt by no means countenance a Toleration, upon Pain of His Soveraignty being called in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And if His Majeſty inſiſt upon Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to His Royal Authority, though in a matter, preſumed on all hands to be innocent and juſt in the Sight of God, and good Men: Yet to colour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of obſtructing Liberty of Conſcience, it ſhall bear the ignominious name
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49038:3"/>
               <hi>of Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and then our Work is done. And though we ſtile the King, God's <hi>Vice-Gerent,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Next unto Thee and Thy Christ, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Moderator and Governour:</hi> If he diſpute our pretended Prelatical Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, the Church Rabble, in ſpight of paſſive Obedience, ſhall be Animated with the dreadful Apprehenſions of Fire and Faggot, to commit all ſorts of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages; as is evident by the late Ryots, upon Diſcharge of the Biſhops: <hi>Aut Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, aut nihil.</hi> The Prelates are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be <hi>Os &amp; Oraculum, Regis &amp; Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae;</hi> and the Voice of the pretended Loyal Party, is, that the King's diſpen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſing Power is clipp'd, and Liberty of Conſcience has received a mortal Wound, and is Breathing its laſt.</p>
            <p>Well, Gentlemen; whilſt there is Life there is Hope; the King is ſtill Head both of Church and State; Your own Conceſſions allow'd him ſo once; 'tis not Three-pence Difference, if upon change of Circumſtances you have chang'd your Opinions; the better part of his Subjects believe it ſtill; and as long as he is inveſted with a Power to Command, all good men will be ready to obey his Lawful Injunctions; and (perhaps) to your Shame, and the Confuſion of all your Intrigues. 'Tis not to be doubted, but he is ſenſible of the Indignity done to His Perſon and Government: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that ought to be left to His own Princely Conduct.</p>
            <p>Thus much I preſumed would not be unacceptable, of the Tranſactions of the time, and the Sentiments of</p>
